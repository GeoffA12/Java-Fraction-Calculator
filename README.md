# Java-fraction-class

This is a Java Fraction calculator implementation. The calculator provides users with a list of choices to which they perform cauclations on two fraction objects. For instance, a user can choose to subtract two fractions with an nput of '-' in the FractionCalc. java class, and then provide an input of two integers on the commmand line. The caluclation and result will be displayed on the console assuming that the input was valid.

The Fraction.java class is the class which contains the object code. The FractionCalculator.java class contains the client code where you can run the program and test out all of the calculator options. 

Error handling and exceptions were used in both object and client classes.
